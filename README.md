# About GuessiT

<h2>Guessit Wordplay</h2>
    <p>This is a simple game where you have to guess the word, randomly generated by the game, within the attempt limit.</p>
    <h4>Begin Button</h4>
    <p>By clicking on "begin" button from the home page, you will be headed straight to the gameplay where you can immediately
        start guessing the word!
    </p>
    <h4>Settings Button</h4>
    <p>Here, you can change the number of attempts you are allowed or choose 3, 4 or 5 letter-words to guess by
        going to the settings.
    </p>

    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>To win this game, you have to guess the random word within the attempt limit.<br>
        For an instance, let's say the random word chosen by the game was <a href="#">"BOAT"</a>.<br>
        Now, if you input the word <a href="#">"Toad"</a> as your first guess, the game will realize that you actually have two letters that matches with the actual word (i.e., 'o' and 'a') and therefore, will be painted green in the "Attempt history" section.<br>
        You may also notice that you had another letter guessed "semi"-correctly. Yes, the letter 'T' is "semi"-correct since it is in the random word but just misplaced. For such cases, the game will present it in yellow.


# Communication contract

  • How to request data
  
    - First, set up an rpyc connection using the 'localhost' and the server's port number which in this case is 18861.
    - Then make connection with root.
    - Create an instance of Task's class and initiate it with a task. The parameters should have name, year, month, day, and priority.
    - To test all the functionality of the mongodb server code, create multiple tasks (since we will later ask the server to sort these tasks in order)
    - Lastly, call the addTask() and on the connection made with root and add each of the task created before.
    - To print out all the tasks the server has received, we make .getAllTasks() call on the connection.
    - To sort the tasks in order of date created, priority and name, we make .sortTasks() call on the connection.
    - Close the connection at the end
  
  • How to receive data
  
    - Each function from server side has a json object as its return.
    - So, to receive, for example, the sorted tasks, we make sure to assign a variable to the .sortTasks() that we make.
    - After this, we can simply print out the tasks from client side to see it evidently that we have received the sorted tasks.
