    <h2>Guessit Wordplay</h2>
    <p>This is a simple game where you have to guess the word, randomly generated by the game, within the attempt limit.</p>
    <h4>Begin Button</h4>
    <p>By clicking on "begin" button from the home page, you will be headed straight to the gameplay where you can immediately
        start guessing the word!
    </p>
    <h4>Settings Button</h4>
    <p>Here, you can change the number of attempts you are allowed or choose 3, 4 or 5 letter-words to guess by
        going to the settings.
    </p>

    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>To win this game, you have to guess the random word within the attempt limit.<br>
        For an instance, let's say the random word chosen by the game was <a href="#">"BOAT"</a>.<br>
        Now, if you input the word <a href="#">"Toad"</a> as your first guess, the game will realize that you actually have two letters that matches with the actual word (i.e., 'o' and 'a') and therefore, will be painted green in the "Attempt history" section.<br>
        You may also notice that you had another letter guessed "semi"-correctly. Yes, the letter 'T' is "semi"-correct since it is in the random word but just misplaced. For such cases, the game will present it in yellow.
